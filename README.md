## Setup

### Prerequisites
- A Cloudflare Workers account
- YouTube Data API v3 key
- YouTube Channel ID

### Worker Setup
1. Deploy the `workers.js` file to Cloudflare Workers
2. Set environment variables:
   ```
   googleAPI = your_youtube_api_key
   channelID = your_youtube_channel_id
   ```
3. Update the worker URL in `index.html` (currently set to `worthless.vertlizofficial.workers.dev`)

### Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Update the worker URL in the JavaScript section if needed
3. Serve the files using any web server
4. For HTTPS (required for PWA features), use a service like ngrok or deploy to a hosting platform

### Deployment
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect your Git repository
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the files
- **Vercel**: Connect your Git repository
- **GitHub Pages**: Enable in repository settings

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

### Quick Setup for CF Pages:
1. **Website (CF Pages):**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Connect repository to CF Pages
   - No build commands needed - static files only
   - Auto-deploys on Git push

2. **API (CF Workers):**
   - Deploy `workers.js` separately to CF Workers
   - Set environment variables for YouTube API
   - Update worker URL in `index.html`

### File Structure:
```
CF Pages (Website):          CF Workers (API):
├── index.html              └── workers.js
├── sw.js                      ↳ Environment Variables:
├── manifest.json                - googleAPI
├── logo.png                     - channelID
└── README.md
```

### Benefits of CF Pages:
- ✅ **HTTPS by default** (required for PWA/Service Workers)
- ✅ **Global CDN** for fast loading
- ✅ **Git integration** for automatic deployments
- ✅ **Free tier** with generous limits
- ✅ **Perfect PWA support** 
- ✅ **Same ecosystem** as your Worker API

## File Structure

```
├── index.html          # Main website file with embedded CSS/JS
├── workers.js          # Cloudflare Workers API backend
├── manifest.json       # PWA manifest for app installation
├── sw.js              # Service worker for caching and offline support
├── logo.png           # Logo/favicon image
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **CORS Errors in Console**
If you see CORS policy errors:
1. **Check your worker URL** - Make sure it's deployed and accessible
2. **Test the worker directly** - Visit `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/health`
3. **Verify environment variables** - Ensure `googleAPI` and `channelID` are set in CF Workers

#### **"Worker not available" Message**
This means the Cloudflare Worker isn't deployed or accessible:
1. **Deploy the worker first** - Follow the Worker Setup section above
2. **Update the worker URL** - Change `WORKER_API_URL` in `index.html`
3. **Site still works** - It will use fallback/cached data

#### **Service Worker Registration Failed**
This is usually a path issue:
- Make sure `sw.js` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- The site works fine without the service worker

#### **Stats Not Updating**
1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify YouTube API key** has proper permissions
3. **Test worker endpoints** directly in browser

### **Working Without the Worker**
The website is designed to work even if the Cloudflare Worker isn't set up:
- ✅ Static stats will be shown
- ✅ Embedded video will work
- ✅ All other features remain functional
- ❌ Live stats updates won't work
- ❌ Latest video won't auto-update
